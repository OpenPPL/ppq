    RoundingPolicy is a core setting for PPQ quantization calculation.
        It defines rounding behaviour inside quantization calculation.

    Formula: quant(x) = clip(round(x / scale, RoundingPolicy), -128, 127)

    PPQ Supports 7 different rounding policies now.
    Take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding

    ATTENTION: RoundingPolicy greatly affects PPQ executor behaviour in some cases, 
        to get a correct result from PPQ executor, 
        make sure your RoundingPolicy is the same as your hardware.

    QuantizationStates is a core data structure for PPQ quantization.
    QuantizationStates tells whether a quantization configuration is activated.

    ATTENTION: Changes of QuantizationState will greatly affect execution result.

    For a TensorQuantizationConfig instance, there are 9 available quantization states now.
    Only when state is ACTIVATED or NEGATIVE, corresponding tensor will be quantized during the execution.

    Here we give a brief description of each quantization state:

        INITIAL: given when TensorQuantizationConfig is created, is an initial state of all quantization configuration.

        PASSIVE_INIT: for particular parameter like bias of GEMM(Convolution) and padding value of Pad. Usually it
        does not have an independent quantization scale and offset, while gets quantized with other tensor's configuration.
            For GEMM and Convolution, there bias will be quantized with input scale * weight scale.
            For padding value and clip value, it shares the same scale with its input.
        Those parameters will have a PASSIVE_INIT state when created.

        ATTENTION: if there is any quantization configuration with INITIAL or PASSIVE_INIT state, PPQ will refuse
            to deploy your model and an error will be thrown. 
            This inspection will be ignored when PPQ.core.config.DEBUG set as True.
        
        OVERLAPPED: state OVERLAPPED means there is someone else takes control of current tensor,
        and overlapped tensor quantization configuration will be ignored by optimization algorithms and executor.
        
        Graph fusion always generate overlapped quantization, for a typical conv - relu fusion,
        the output quantization of convolution will be overlapped by the output tensor of relu. 
        State OVERLAPPED cares only about quantization behaviour that cross layers.

        DEACTIVATED: state DEACTIVATED is related with "dequantize" function, once an operation is dequantized,
        all related tensor configurations will be replaced as DEACTIVATED, so that skipping all quantization during
        execution.

        SHAPE: whenever a tensor quantization configuration holds SHAPE state,
            it will be never quantized and will not be included into any optimization algorithm.
        it means underlying tensor is shape-related tensor, and it can not be quantized.

        ACTIVATE: means corresponding tensor is ready to be quantized with its configuration.

        PASSIVE: means corresponding tensor is ready to be quantized with its configuration.
            (however its configuration is not stand alone, it still depends on someone else.)
        
        BAKED: means corresponding tensor has been pre-quantized, its value can directly 
            go forward without quantization.

    QuantizationProperty is a core abstraction for PPQ quantization calculation.
    QuantizationProperty and QuantizationPolicy together build a bitmap to describe quantization policy.

    A QuantizationPolicy instance contains multiple QuantizationProperty,
        QuantizationPolicy is used in PPQ (alone with other configuration) to describe how a tensor is quantized.
    
    During simulating, executor will quantize tensor corresponding to its QuantizationPolicy.
        (QuantizationPolicy is included by TensorQuantizationConfig)

    There are 7 different quantization property(s) supported by PPQ now.
    
        PER_TENSOR: Also known as per-layer quantization, which mean all parameters of this layer share the same scale and offset.
            (For Convulution layer and Gemm layer which has bias, bias layer will be negative quantized, they do not have a valid scale)
        
        PER_CHANNEL: parameters are quantized alone channel axis, each channel has a stand-alone scale and offset.

        LINEAR: Indicates a linear quantization, follow formula: quant(x) = clip(round(x / scale))

        EXPONENTIAL: Indicates an exponential quantization, not yet used.

        SYMMETRICAL: Indicates a symmetrical quantization, offset is deactivated in this mode.

        ASYMMETRICAL: Indicates an asymmetrical quantization, offset is activated in this mode.

        POWER_OF_2: Indicates a power-of-2 quantization, scale must be pow(2, k) in this mode.

    ATTENTION: Not all combinations of all 7 QuantizationProperty are valid, see QuantizationPolicy.__check_valid
    ATTENTION: QuantizationPolicy is read-only, user can only assign its value when created, the only interface of 
        QuantizationPolicy is function QuantizationPolicy.has_property.

    TensorQuantizationConfig, as known as tensor quantization configuration, is the most
        important data structure in PPQ system.
    
    PPQ generates quantization configuration for all tensors that need to be quantized, and control their 
        quantization logic via this abstraction. As a basic building block of PPQ quantization system, tensor
        quantization is designed to store and manage all quantization related information like:

        Quantization policy, rounding policy, quantization bits, scale, offset, quantization state, etc.

    ATTENTION: tensor(or variable in PPQ) might have more than one quantization configuration, since
        PPQ is designed as an operation-oriented quantization system, so to say tensor quantization configurations
        are created operation by operation. Considering a pattern conv - conv, both the upstream convolution layer
        and the downstream convolution layer will hold a tensor quantization configuration of the middle variable. 
        Duplicated quantization configuration will be disabled by optimization pass later.

    PPQ is designed as an operation-oriented quantization system, literally all tensor quantization configurations
        are managed by operations, through you can access their image by variable instance.
        (see the defination of PPQ.IR.quant.QuantableVariable for more information)

    You are supposed to change tensor quantization configuration during optimization passes, this abstraction 
        is widely tested among various platforms, it shall satisfy most of your quantization demands.
