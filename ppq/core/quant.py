    TargetPlatform is a core abstraction of PPQ framework,
        it defines "platform" as an attribute of an operation.
    Platform attribute of an operation indicates where this operation is going to be deployed.
    This feature enables PPQ to simulate inter-device computing.

    Platform attribute also tells PPQ how to quantize an operation, and how to execute it.
        ATTENTION: Different platform might bring different behaviour of a same operation.
        ATTENTION: Operation which is assigned to an non-quantizible platform will never be quantized.

    There are several supported platforms for PPQ now, 
        however you are supposed to be aware of some particular platforms here:

    SHAPE_OR_INDEX is a virtual platform, however it is an EXTREMELY IMPORTANT components in PPQ.
        Dispatch an operation to platform SHAPE_OR_INDEX means this operation is SOI-related,
        it processes a SOI tensor and gives a processed SOI, all calculation of this operation must be sent to CPU
            (or any platform capable for calculating this.) when deploy.

        An operation with SHAPE_OR_INDEX platform assigned will never be quantized regardless of its type.
        It is a crucial feature for quantizing network that contains SOI-related operation. (Shufflenet etc.)

        By default, PPQ automatically detects all SOI-related operations, and dispatch them to SHAPE_OR_INDEX platform.
        To understand how this feature works, see also: ppq.sche

    UNSPECIFIED is a virtual platform, all operations are sent to this platform once they were created.
        Quantizer then dispatches them towards desired platform through its quantization logic.

    QuantizationStates is a core data structure for PPQ quantization.
    QuantizationStates tells whether a quantization configuration is activated.

    ATTENTION: Changes of QuantizationState will greatly affect execution result.

    For a TensorQuantizationConfig instance, there are 11 available quantization states now.
    Only when state is ACTIVATED or NEGATIVE, corresponding tensor will be quantized during the execution.

    Here we give a brief description of each quantization state:

        INITIAL: given when TensorQuantizationConfig is created, is an initial state of all quantization configuration.

        PASSIVE_INIT: for particular parameter like bias of GEMM(Convolution) and padding value of Pad. Usually it
        does not have an independent quantization scale and offset, while gets quantized with other tensor's configuration.
            For GEMM and Convolution, there bias will be quantized with input scale * weight scale.
            For padding value and clip value, it shares the same scale with its input.
        Those parameters will have a PASSIVE_INIT state when created.

        ATTENTION: if there is any quantization configuration with INITIAL or PASSIVE_INIT state, PPQ will refuse
            to deploy your model and an error will be thrown. 
            This inspection will be ignored when PPQ.core.config.DEBUG set as True.
        
        OVERLAPPED: state OVERLAPPED means there is someone else takes control of current tensor,
        and overlapped tensor quantization configuration will be ignored by optimization algorithms and executor.
        
        Graph fusion always generate overlapped quantization, for a typical conv - relu fusion,
        the output quantization of convolution will be overlapped by the output tensor of relu. 
        State OVERLAPPED cares only about quantization behaviour that cross layers.

        DEACTIVATED: state DEACTIVATED is related with "dequantize" function, once an operation is dequantized,
        all related tensor configurations will be replaced as DEACTIVATED, so that skipping all quantization during
        execution.

        SOI: whenever a tensor quantization configuration holds SOI state,
            it will be never quantized and will not be included into any optimization algorithm.
        it means underlying tensor is SOI-related tensor, and it can not be quantized.

        ACTIVATE: means corresponding tensor is ready to be quantized with its configuration.

        PASSIVE: means corresponding tensor is ready to be quantized with its configuration.
            (however its configuration is not stand alone, it still depends on someone else.)
        
        BAKED: means corresponding tensor has been pre-quantized, its value can directly 
            go forward without quantization.
